## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production into the `build` folder.\
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.\
Your app is now ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you're unsatisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project, giving you full control over them. All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts, allowing you to tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to use `eject` ever if you don't want to. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool might not be useful if you can't customize it when you're ready.
